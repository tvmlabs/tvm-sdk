# Overview

**Bee Engine** is an embeddable mining engine and contract system that allows any application to run [**NACKL**](https://docs.ackinacki.com/glossary#nackl) **mining on the client side** and securely validate the results on the blockchain.

The core idea of Bee Engine is **mining as a background process**, independent of the application type.

It can be a game, a utility, a document editor or even a non-gaming service.

A user can play chess, work with text, or use any other application —\
**while simultaneously mining NACKL**&#x20;

### What Bee Engine Solves

Bee Engine enables developers to:

* Embed mining directly into their applications
* Use client-side computation without trusting the client
* Distribute rewards based on verifiable results
* Build reputation and reward systems based on real user contribution

Mining becomes **part of the user experience**, not a separate process.

### Architecture

Bee Engine consists of two logically independent but connected components.

#### 1. Client Bee Engine Miner

Code that runs on the client side.

It is responsible for:

* Hash computation (Proof-of-Work)
* Result aggregation
* Building a Merkle Tree based on completed work
* Preparing data for subsequent verification

The Bee Engin Miner can operate:

* in the background
* with resource limitations
* in parallel with the main application logic

#### 2. Mobile Verifiers Miner Subsystem Contracts

This [on-chain contract subsystem](https://github.com/ackinacki/ackinacki/tree/main/contracts/mvsystem) provides:

* Mining rules
* Work validation
* Reward economics
* Extensible logic (reputation, penalties, limits, seasons, etc.)

It:

* Accepts the Merkle Tree generated by the client
* Verifies correctness of computations
* Validates that the work was actually performed
* Distributes rewards (NACKL)
* May take into account reputation, frequency, and client behavior

This part **fully distrusts the client** — only cryptographically provable data is verified.

### Universality

Bee Engine is not tied to any specific application type.

Any application can:

* Run NACKL mining
* Start and stop the mining process
* Obtain verifiable results
* Integrate rewards and reputation into its mechanics

This can be: a game, a web application, a desktop utility, productivity software, any client with computational resources.

**This documentation is intended for developers who want to:**

* Integrate Bee Engine into their application
* Understand the Bee Engin Miner and verifier architecture
* Customize mining behavior for their product

In the following section, we will go through the integration scenario in detail.
