# Schema

A schema defines a type system of GraphQL API. It describes the complete set of possible data (objects, fields, relationships, everything) that a client can access.

* Root types
* Non-root types
* Query types
* Subscription types
* Mutation types
* Syntax

## Root types

TON Labs GraphQL schema has three root types:

* query
* mutation
* subscription

The [query type](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.

The [mutation type](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that change data on the server. It is analogous to performing HTTP verbs such as `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. Mutations are used to send messages to the blockchain. We recommend to do it only via SDK, not directly.

The **subscription** root type – a long‐lived request that fetches data in response to source events.

Check out [EVER-SDK net module](https://docs.everos.dev/ever-sdk/reference/types-and-methods/mod\_net) - the official EverX wrapper over GraphQL API for root queries and subscriptions.

## Non-root types

See non-root type descriptions in Field descriptions section.

**Aggregation queries (available only on dedicated nodes):**

| name                  | description                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| aggregateBlocks       | Get aggregation info about blocks: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE functions over blocks data.             |
| aggregateTransactions | Get aggregation info about transactions: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE functions over transactions data. |
| aggregateMessages     | Get aggregation info about messages: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE functions over messages data.         |
| aggregateAccounts     | Get aggregation info about accounts: COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE functions over accounts data.         |

## Subscription types (Soon)

* blocks
* accounts
* messages
* transaction
* blocks\_signatures

## Mutation types

* postRequests - used to send messages to blockchain.
* sendMessage - used to send message to blockchain (using API v2).

## Syntax

Read about GraphQL syntax in its [`official documentation`](https://graphql.org/). In this example we query account info:

```graphql
query {
  blockchain{
   account(address:"0:653b9a6452c7a982c6dc92b2da9eba832ade1c467699ebb3b43dca6d77b780dd"){
    info{
      address
      acc_type
      balance
      last_paid
      last_trans_lt
      boc
      data
      code
      library
      data_hash
      code_hash
      library_hash
    }
    transactions(last:1){
      edges{
        node{
          hash
          now
          balance_delta
        }
      }
    }
  }
  }
}
```

Here you can see a request for account's information and the last transaction with a subset of fields. All available fields with their descriptions can be found in data schema in playground.

A selection set must contain only scalar fields, otherwise you will get an error. A scalar field describes one discrete piece of information available to a request within a selection set. If field is an object, you need to specify the fields of this object.
