## Functions

### proof\_block\_data

Proves that a given block's data, which is queried from TVM API, can be trusted.

This function checks block proofs and compares given data with the proven. If the given data differs from the proven, the exception will be thrown. The input param is a single block's JSON object, which was queried from DApp server using functions such as `net.query`, `net.query_collection` or `net.wait_for_collection`. If block's BOC is not provided in the JSON, it will be queried from DApp server (in this case it is required to provide at least `id` of block).

Please note, that joins (like `signatures` in `Block`) are separated entities and not supported, so function will throw an exception in a case if JSON being checked has such entities in it.

If `cache_in_local_storage` in config is set to `true` (default), downloaded proofs and master-chain BOCs are saved into the persistent local storage (e.g. file system for native environments or browser's IndexedDB for the web); otherwise all the data is cached only in memory in current client's context and will be lost after destruction of the client.

**Why Proofs are needed**

Proofs are needed to ensure that the data downloaded from a DApp server is real blockchain data. Checking proofs can protect from the malicious DApp server which can potentially provide fake data, or also from "Man in the Middle" attacks class.

**What Proofs are**

Simply, proof is a list of signatures of validators', which have signed this particular master- block.

The very first validator set's public keys are included in the zero-state. Whe know a root hash of the zero-state, because it is stored in the network configuration file, it is our authority root. For proving zero-state it is enough to calculate and compare its root hash.

In each new validator cycle the validator set is changed. The new one is stored in a key-block, which is signed by the validator set, which we already trust, the next validator set will be stored to the new key-block and signed by the current validator set, and so on.

In order to prove any block in the master-chain we need to check, that it has been signed by a trusted validator set. So we need to check all key-blocks' proofs, started from the zero-state and until the block, which we want to prove. But it can take a lot of time and traffic to download and prove all key-blocks on a client. For solving this, special trusted blocks are used in TVM-SDK.

The trusted block is the authority root, as well, as the zero-state. Each trusted block is the `id` (e.g. `root_hash`) of the already proven key-block. There can be plenty of trusted blocks, so there can be a lot of authority roots. The hashes of trusted blocks for MainNet and TestNet are hardcoded in SDK in a separated binary file (trusted\_key\_blocks.bin) and is being updated for each release by using `update_trusted_blocks` utility.

See [update\_trusted\_blocks](https://github.com/tvmlabs/tvm-sdk/blob/main/tools/update_trusted_blocks/README.md) directory for more info.

In future SDK releases, one will also be able to provide their hashes of trusted blocks for other networks, besides for MainNet and DevNet. By using trusted key-blocks, in order to prove any block, we can prove chain of key-blocks to the closest previous trusted key-block, not only to the zero-state.

But shard-blocks don't have proofs on DApp server. In this case, in order to prove any shard- block data, we search for a corresponding master-block, which contains the root hash of this shard-block, or some shard block which is linked to that block in shard-chain. After proving this master-block, we traverse through each link and calculate and compare hashes with links, one-by-one. After that we can ensure that this shard-block has also been proven.

```ts
type ParamsOfProofBlockData = {
    block: any
}

function proof_block_data(
    params: ParamsOfProofBlockData,
): Promise<void>;

function proof_block_data_sync(
    params: ParamsOfProofBlockData,
): void;
```

NOTE: Sync version is available only for `lib-node` binding.

#### Parameters

* `block`: _any_ – Single block's data, retrieved from TVM API, that needs proof. Required fields are `id` and/or top-level `boc` (for block identification), others are optional.

### proof\_transaction\_data

Proves that a given transaction's data, which is queried from TVM API, can be trusted.

This function requests the corresponding block, checks block proofs, ensures that given transaction exists in the proven block and compares given data with the proven. If the given data differs from the proven, the exception will be thrown. The input parameter is a single transaction's JSON object (see params description), which was queried from TVM API using functions such as `net.query`, `net.query_collection` or `net.wait_for_collection`.

If transaction's BOC and/or `block_id` are not provided in the JSON, they will be queried from TVM API.

Please note, that joins (like `account`, `in_message`, `out_messages`, etc. in `Transaction` entity) are separated entities and not supported, so function will throw an exception in a case if JSON being checked has such entities in it.

For more information about proofs checking, see description of `proof_block_data` function.

```ts
type ParamsOfProofTransactionData = {
    transaction: any
}

function proof_transaction_data(
    params: ParamsOfProofTransactionData,
): Promise<void>;

function proof_transaction_data_sync(
    params: ParamsOfProofTransactionData,
): void;
```

NOTE: Sync version is available only for `lib-node` binding.

#### Parameters

* `transaction`: _any_ – Single transaction's data as queried from DApp server, without modifications. The required fields are `id` and/or top-level `boc`, others are optional. In order to reduce network requests count, it is recommended to provide `block_id` and `boc` of transaction.

### proof\_message\_data

Proves that a given message's data, which is queried from TONOS API, can be trusted.

This function first proves the corresponding transaction, ensures that the proven transaction refers to the given message and compares given data with the proven. If the given data differs from the proven, the exception will be thrown. The input parameter is a single message's JSON object (see params description), which was queried from TONOS API using functions such as `net.query`, `net.query_collection` or `net.wait_for_collection`.

If message's BOC and/or non-null `src_transaction.id` or `dst_transaction.id` are not provided in the JSON, they will be queried from TONOS API.

Please note, that joins (like `block`, `dst_account`, `dst_transaction`, `src_account`, `src_transaction`, etc. in `Message` entity) are separated entities and not supported, so function will throw an exception in a case if JSON being checked has such entities in it.

For more information about proofs checking, see description of `proof_block_data` function.

```ts
type ParamsOfProofMessageData = {
    message: any
}

function proof_message_data(
    params: ParamsOfProofMessageData,
): Promise<void>;

function proof_message_data_sync(
    params: ParamsOfProofMessageData,
): void;
```

NOTE: Sync version is available only for `lib-node` binding.

#### Parameters

* `message`: _any_ – Single message's data as queried from DApp server, without modifications. The required fields are `id` and/or top-level `boc`, others are optional. In order to reduce network requests count, it is recommended to provide at least `boc` of message and non-null `src_transaction.id` or `dst_transaction.id`.
